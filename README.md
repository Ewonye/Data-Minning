# projects
A project on Data mining using digits data. I applied PCA to get better features and reduce the dimension. I also applied Agglomerative and Kmeans Clustering to get a better analysis of the data since it is unsupervised 
In MachineLearning_Assignment2.ipynb , I used some classification models to determine if a transaction is fradulent or not.
